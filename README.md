# 🏥 Emergency Room Visit Analysis
## *Transforming OpenEMR Data into Clinical Insights*

*A data-driven exploration of ER patterns through OpenEMR exports*

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project transforms raw OpenEMR exports into meaningful insights about emergency room visits, revealing patterns in patient demographics, vital signs, procedures, and follow-up care. Think of it as translating the complex story of emergency medicine into clear, actionable data narratives.

**The Journey**: Raw OpenEMR data → Cleaned relational database → Clinical insights through Python analysis

---

## 🎯 The Questions We Explored

Every data analysis begins with curiosity. Here are the clinical questions that guided our exploration:

- **What brings patients to the ER most frequently?** Understanding common visit reasons helps in resource planning and triage optimization
- **Do abnormal vital signs predict hospitalization?** Exploring the relationship between physiological markers and clinical outcomes
- **Which procedures dominate across different age groups?** Identifying age-specific care patterns and resource needs
- **Are there demographic patterns in ER utilization?** Examining how sex and age influence healthcare-seeking behavior
- **How often do ER visits lead to follow-up prescriptions?** Understanding the continuum of care and medication management

---

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### Visit Patterns
- **Most common reasons**: General examinations, well-child visits, symptom evaluations, and prenatal care
- **Clinical insight**: The ER serves as both emergency care and primary care access point

### Vital Signs & Outcomes
- **Hospitalized patients** showed significantly elevated pulse and respiration rates
- **Clinical significance**: Abnormal vitals may serve as early indicators for admission decisions

### Procedure Distribution
- **Orders and lab tests** dominate across all age groups
- **Age-specific patterns**: Different age groups show distinct procedure preferences

### Demographics
- **Gender distribution**: Female patients outnumber males across all age groups
- **Peak utilization**: Highest volume in the 51+ age group, particularly among females
- **Healthcare access**: Suggests potential differences in healthcare-seeking behavior

### Prescription Patterns
- **Follow-up rate**: 97% of ER visits resulted in prescription recommendations
- **Top medications**: Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, Lisinopril, Naproxen, Hydrochlorothiazide
- **Clinical continuity**: High prescription rate indicates strong follow-up care integration

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
OpenEMR Exports → Python Cleaning → MySQL Database → Jupyter Analysis

### Technology Stack
- **Data Processing**: Python (pandas, mysql-connector-python)
- **Database**: MySQL with normalized schema
- **Analysis**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Visualization**: Python plotting libraries

### Database Schema
Our relational model captures the complexity of healthcare data:

- **Patient** (demographics, location linkage)
- **Location** (geographic data)
- **Form_Encounter** (visit details, reasons)
- **Vitals** (physiological measurements)
- **Prescription** (medication recommendations)
- **Procedure_Order** & **Procedure_Report** (clinical procedures)

*Load order ensures referential integrity: Location → Patient → Form_Encounter → Vitals → Prescription → Procedure_Order → Procedure_Report*

---

## 📊 Methodology

### Data Cleaning Philosophy
- Preserved core clinical fields (patient ID, demographics, vital signs)
- Introduced geographic dimension for location-based analysis
- Maintained referential integrity across all tables
- Applied clinical validation rules for vital sign ranges

### Analysis Approach
- **Descriptive statistics** for visit patterns and demographics
- **Comparative analysis** between hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients
- **Age-stratified analysis** using clinically meaningful age groups (0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51+)
- **Rule-based flagging** for abnormal vital signs using established clinical thresholds

### Clinical Thresholds Applied
- **Temperature**: >38°C (fever)
- **Pulse**: >100 bpm (tachycardia)
- **Respiration**: >24/min (tachypnea)
